# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI-powered video editor application built with Laravel 12, Inertia.js v2, and Svelte 5. Users create scene-based video compositions, generate assets via AI (fal.ai), arrange them on a timeline with overlays, and export to MP4 via server-side FFmpeg.

**Key Features:**
- Scene-based video composition (not frame-accurate NLE)
- AI generation: text-to-image, image-to-video, text-to-music, text-to-speech
- Drag-and-drop layers with resize handles
- Multi-track audio timeline
- FFmpeg-based server-side rendering

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development (server + queue + logs + vite)
composer run dev

# Run all tests
php artisan test --compact

# Run specific test file or filter
php artisan test --compact --filter=AuthenticationTest
php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/Auth/AuthenticationTest.php

# Lint PHP (auto-fix)
vendor/bin/pint --dirty

# Type check Svelte/TypeScript
npm run check

# Build frontend
npm run build
```

## Architecture

### Backend (Laravel 12)
- **Routes**: `routes/web.php` (main), `routes/settings.php` (settings), `routes/editor.php` (video editor)
- **Controllers**: `app/Http/Controllers/` - Settings controllers handle profile, password, 2FA
- **Middleware**: Configured in `bootstrap/app.php` (Laravel 12 style, no Kernel.php)
- **Auth**: Laravel Fortify provides authentication routes/controllers

### Video Editor Backend
- **Routes**: `routes/editor.php` - Project CRUD, asset upload, generation, render endpoints
- **Models**:
  - `Project` - scenes (JSON), audio_tracks (JSON), resolution, status
  - `Asset` - uploaded/generated media files with metadata
  - `Generation` - AI generation requests (text-to-image, image-to-video, etc.)
  - `Render` - FFmpeg render jobs with progress tracking
- **Enums**: `app/Enums/` - AssetType, AssetSource, GenerationType, GenerationStatus, ProjectStatus, RenderStatus
- **Services**:
  - `FalAIService` - fal.ai API integration for AI generation
  - `FalAI/FalClient` - Low-level HTTP client for fal.ai queue API
  - `FalAI/ModelConfig` - Model configurations with parameters and defaults
  - `FFmpegService` - Video rendering, concatenation, audio mixing
- **Jobs**: `ProcessAssetUpload`, `RunGeneration`, `RenderProject` (queued)
- **Policies**: `ProjectPolicy`, `AssetPolicy` for authorization

### Frontend (Svelte 5 + Inertia)
- **Entry**: `resources/js/app.ts`
- **Pages**: `resources/js/pages/` - Inertia pages
- **Layouts**: `resources/js/layouts/` - AppLayout, AuthLayout with variants
- **UI Library**: `resources/js/components/ui/` - shadcn-svelte (new-york-v4)
- **Types**: `resources/js/types/`
- **Utilities**: `resources/js/lib/` - `cn()` helper, theme, etc.

### Video Editor Frontend
- **Page**: `resources/js/pages/editor/Show.svelte` - Main editor page
- **Components**: `resources/js/components/editor/`
  - `SceneStrip.svelte` - Horizontal scene timeline with drag-to-reorder
  - `SceneCard.svelte` - Scene thumbnail with playback indicator
  - `SceneEditor.svelte` - WYSIWYG canvas for layer editing
  - `LayerItem.svelte` - Draggable/resizable layer with handles
  - `PreviewPlayer.svelte` - Playback controls and time display
  - `AssetPanel.svelte` - Upload and asset gallery
  - `AudioTracks.svelte` - Multi-track audio timeline
  - `RightPanel.svelte` - Properties and AI generation tabs
  - `EditorToolbar.svelte` - Save, export, zoom controls
- **Stores**: `resources/js/lib/editor/`
  - `project.svelte.ts` - Project state, scene/layer/audio CRUD
  - `timeline.svelte.ts` - Playback state, current time, scene switching
  - `selection.svelte.ts` - Selected scene/layer, current tool
- **Types**: `resources/js/types/editor.ts` - Project, Scene, Layer, AudioTrack interfaces

### Path Aliases
- `@/` maps to `resources/js/`
- `@/actions/` and `@/routes/` - Wayfinder-generated route functions

## UI Components (shadcn-svelte)

```bash
npx shadcn-svelte@next add <component-name>
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
FAL_KEY=your_fal_ai_key  # Required for AI generation
```

## AI Generation Models (fal.ai)

Models are configured in `app/Services/FalAI/ModelConfig.php`:

**Text to Image:**
- FLUX.1 Dev/Schnell/Pro Ultra - High-quality flow transformer
- Recraft V3 - SOTA with typography support
- Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large

**Image to Video:**
- MiniMax Video - Natural motion
- Kling 1.0 Standard/Pro - Reliable video generation
- Luma Dream Machine - Dreamlike transitions
- Wan 2.1 - High fidelity

**Audio:**
- Stable Audio - Music and SFX from text
- MusicGen - Melody generation
- Kokoro/F5-TTS/PlayHT - Text-to-speech

## Key Conventions

- Svelte 5 runes: `$props()`, `$state()`, `$derived()`
- Layouts use snippets: `{@render children?.()}`
- Editor stores use singleton pattern with `$state` for reactivity
- Layer types: `video`, `image`, `text` - each with specific properties
- Scene durations in milliseconds (`duration_ms`)

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `wayfinder-development` — Activates whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components. Use when importing from @/actions or @/routes, calling Laravel routes from TypeScript, or working with Wayfinder route functions.
- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 4 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, browser testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `inertia-svelte-development` — Develops Inertia.js v2 Svelte client-side applications. Activates when creating Svelte pages, forms, or navigation; using Link, Form, or router; working with deferred props, prefetching, or polling; or when user mentions Svelte with Inertia, Svelte pages, Svelte forms, or Svelte navigation.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.
- `developing-with-fortify` — Laravel Fortify headless authentication backend development. Activate when implementing authentication features including login, registration, password reset, email verification, two-factor authentication (2FA/TOTP), profile updates, headless auth, authentication scaffolding, or auth guards in Laravel applications.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs for the user.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(S). It is always available through Laravel Herd.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-svelte-development` when working with Inertia Svelte client-side patterns.

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scrolling (merging props + `WhenVisible`), lazy loading on scroll, polling, prefetching.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder generates TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

- IMPORTANT: Activate `wayfinder-development` skill whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components.
- Invokable Controllers: `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`.
- Parameter Binding: Detects route keys (`{post:slug}`) — `show({ slug: "my-post" })`.
- Query Merging: `show(1, { mergeQuery: { page: 2, sort: null } })` merges with current URL, `null` removes params.
- Inertia: Use `.form()` with `<Form>` component or `form.submit(store())` with useForm.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== inertia-svelte/core rules ===

# Inertia + Svelte

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-svelte-development` when working with Inertia Svelte client-side patterns.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.

=== laravel/fortify rules ===

# Laravel Fortify

- Fortify is a headless authentication backend that provides authentication routes and controllers for Laravel applications.
- IMPORTANT: Always use the `search-docs` tool for detailed Laravel Fortify patterns and documentation.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `developing-with-fortify` skill when working with Fortify authentication features.
